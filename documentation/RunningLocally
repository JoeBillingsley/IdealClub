First install git if it's not already
  sudo apt-get install git

Clone the repo off of github and then change to the pages branch
  git clone https://github.com/JoeTheAverage/IdealClub.git
  git checkout gh-pages

All of the site files should now be

Now run this to install ruby-install
  wget -O ruby-install-0.6.0.tar.gz https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install/archive/v0.6.0.tar.gz
  tar -xzvf ruby-install-0.6.0.tar.gz
  cd ruby-install-0.6.0/
  sudo make install

Next install ruby
  sudo ruby-install ruby

Wait 10 minutes whilst shitloads of text passes before you. 
Maybe make a cup of tea or practice your scales or something this bit takes ages to run.

Next install chruby which will let us use what we've just installed
  wget -O chruby-0.3.9.tar.gz https://github.com/postmodern/chruby/archive/v0.3.9.tar.gz
  tar -xzvf chruby-0.3.9.tar.gz
  cd chruby-0.3.9/
  sudo make install

Open your bash rc file
  nano ~/.bashrc

And copy this in at the bottom:
  source /usr/local/share/chruby/chruby.sh

Close the terminal and open a new one. In the new terminal run:
  chruby

You should hopefully get something like 'ruby-2.3.0' out. Now run:
  chruby ruby-2.3.0

and
  gem install bundler

Very almost there. Now we actually install the program we want to run! Run:
   bundle install

Finally run the following:
   jekyll serve

And navigate to localhost:4000 in a browser.


If any of the above fails to work for whatever reason, good luck!
